## Overview of the Project
This project aims to create an interactive web page that represents Unidentified Flying Object (UFOs) sightings information related to the annual gathering. The JavaScript is used to display a table, and the filter is added to limit the information that the user needs. The filter can be applied on a date, country, city, state, and shape. Also, the web page is customized using Bootstrap.
